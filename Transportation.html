        <h2>About Taniti's Transportation</h2>
        <p>
          Taniti's airport makes it easy to get to our wonderful island, and it
          will soon be even easier. Our ongoing airport expansion project will
          open up Taniti to even more vistors. Cruise ships are another popular
          travel method, and bring people weekly.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once on the island, Taniti offers a variety of options to make getting
          around the island a breeze. We have public and private busses, as well
          as car rentals. Bikes are also for rent, and the island is considered
          very walkable for those who like to travel by foot.
